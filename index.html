            <p>
              I used a Deep Neural Net model for performing Human Pose Estimation in OpenCV.Pose estimation has many uses, from interactive installations that react to the body to augmented reality, animation, fitness uses, and more.

              Computationally detecting human body language is becoming effective and accessible. This project explores enabling technologies, applications & implications.

              Hand Gesture Recognition
            </h3>
            <p>
              Gesture recognition has been a very interesting problem in Computer Vision community for a long time. This is particularly due to the fact that segmentation of foreground object from a cluttered background is a challenging problem in real-time. The most obvious reason is because of the semantic gap involved when a human looks at an image and a computer looking at the same image. Humans can easily figure out what’s in an image but for a computer, images are just 3-dimensional matrices. It is because of this, computer vision problems remains a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project works to recognize hand gestures from a live video sequence. To recognize these gestures from a live video sequence, we first need to github repositorytake out the hand region alone removing all the unwanted portions in the video sequence. After segmenting the hand region, we then count the fingers shown in the video sequence to instruct a robot based on the finger count.

              Face recognition with OpenCV: Haar Cascade
            </h3>
            <p>
              Object detection is a powerful instrument. I have used OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) which is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library and easy to import in Python.
            </p>

            <p>
              Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images (where positive images are those where the object to be detected is present, negative are those where it is not). It is then used to detect objects in other images. OpenCV offers pre-trained Haar cascade algorithms, organized into categories (faces, eyes and so forth), depending on the images they have been trained on.

              2048 Game
            </h3>
            <p>
              2048 is perhaps one of the most addictive mathematical puzzle games. For starters, it is played on a 4 × 4 game board which begins with an initial configuration of two tiles, of value 2 or 4, placed at arbitrary locations on the grid.
            </p>
            <p>
              The player then selects to move Up, Down, Left, or Right. Each move shifts all tiles on the grid in the direction chosen. If two adjacent tiles have the same value, they combine, and the single resulting tile after the combination will be the sum (twice). Following the player’s move, a tile of value 2 or 4 will be generated at a random position on the board.
